# Real-Time-Stock-Market-Data-Tracker
This program is built by python, which can be compiled by vs code and Python IDLE

The source code is stored as "CSCI2100_project_source_code"

Only "random" module is needed for this program. 

A test file "test_ops" is included in the folder, which contain  40110 operations.

I also build a testing program which compares the output of my code with a naive stock_tracker program. This navie program can deliver the required output but does not fulfill the time
complexity requirement.

The file is stored as "testing_program". You can use it to test the code if needed. It will print "All operations passed successfully." if the all the output matches. Otherwise, it will create a file that prints all the unmatched output.
